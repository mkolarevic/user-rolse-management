# roles-management

Vue 3 + TypeScript + Pinia

## Starting the app

`npm i`
`npm run dev`

Notes:
- On local dev, Chrome throws an error `crbug/1173575, non-JS module files deprecated.` which I didn't have the time to troubleshoot. Please use Firefox (sorry).

## Not implemented yet (TODO)

- Edit role (WIP)
- Confirmation dialog for delete and edit roles
- Finish with styles
- Fix code structure
- Result pagination
